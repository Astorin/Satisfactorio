# Satisfactorio
Factorio overhaul mod that brings Satisfactory mechanics into the game.

Being an overhaul mod, compatibility with QoL mods is probably fine but it obviously won't work with other overhaul mods.

## Core gameplay changes
### Mining
- Ore patches are replaced with nodes. Nodes appear in small clusters and provide infinite resources at a slow rate.
- Nodes can be Impure, Normal or Pure. In Factorio this is represented as 100%, 200% and 400% yield (in Map view, the "node" is actually 9 tiles for a "combined yield" of 900%, 1800% and 3600%)
- The types of resources you can find vary the further away from spawn you are, with basic resources close by and more advanced ones further away.
- With increased distance also comes better chances at nodes with higher purity.
- You can also find resource deposits scattered around, which can be mined for extra resources.
- At the start you will be hand-mining resources, then using a Portable Miner (which cannot be pulled from automatically), then automated Miners.

### Crafting
- Hand crafting is limited exclusively to putting materials together into a building, essentially just the Build Gun from Satisfactory. You can also take a building apart to retrieve the materials. After all, FICSIT does not waste!
- Crafting of intermediate products is done at the Craft Bench (one of these is provided in the HUB), which must be manually attended in order to work. No automation here!
- Various crafting machines can be fed by belts. This is done by connecting the belt directly to the machine, as there are no Inserters in this mod.

### Power
- The first tier of power is the Biomass Burner, which must be manually fed fuel to run. Fuel consumption is scaled to usage, no worries there.
- Automated power is unlocked gradually.
- If power demand exceeds production, you'll trigger a blackout! Either increase production or decrease consumption, then open any connected generator to restore power.

### Combat
- Biters are replaced with enemies from Satisfactory.
- They don't spawn bases, but instead appear in the wild - typically near resource nodes and other points of interest.
- The further out you go, the higher the chance of running into Alpha versions of enemies.
- Combat is mostly done with melee weapons, such as the Xeno-zapper, but the Rebar Gun and Rifle are available. The Rebar Gun is a cheap projectile, while the rifle is hitscan (but it costs $400,000 to fire for twelve seconds)

### Research / Progression
- Progression is made in three different places: the HUB, the M.A.M. and the Space Elevator.
- The HUB allows you to deposit the requested items to unlock Milestones, which are the main points of progress through the game.
- The M.A.M. replaces the Factorio tech tree. Deposit the requested items to begin research, then wait.
- The Space Elevator allows automated delivery of items. The items are relatively complex and cannot be crafted at the Craft Bench. Successful launch of the Space Elevator unlocks additional tiers of Milestones.
