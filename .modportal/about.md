* Pet the doggos!
* Set up self-driving cars to transport materials between sections of your factory

## Getting started
You begin the game by landing on Nauvis in your Drop Pod and searching for iron. Build your HUB nearby and get to work at the Craft Bench.

Unlock your first few buildings and deploy them with the Build Gun - select a building from the menu and the ingredients will be pulled from your inventory. Mine a building to recover its components!

![Build gun demo](https://github.com/PFQNiet/Satisfactorio/raw/master/.modportal/build-gun.mp4)

Continue submitting materials to complete Milestones at the HUB, unlocking more and more options:

![HUB Milestone selection demo](https://github.com/PFQNiet/Satisfactorio/raw/master/.modportal/hub-selection.mp4)

And before long you'll have your first automated setups!

![Simple production line: iron ore, smelted into ingots, then pressed into plates](https://github.com/PFQNiet/Satisfactorio/raw/master/.modportal/tiny-production-line.mp4)

But beware: over-drawing power will break the generator's fuse, resulting in a blackout. You'll need to increase power production and/or decrease demand before resetting the power network.

## Progression
Conveyor belts transport items from building to building. Splitters and Mergers allow you to distribute your items either 1:2 or 1:3, and the Smart Splitter lets you define filters for sorting items.

Program a self-driving car to deliver resources around your base!

Tame wild Lizard Doggos (which look suspiciously like Small Biters...) and they'll occasionally give you loot:

More mobility options include the Jetpack, Hyper tubes and the Zipline, allowing quick and easy traversal of your factory.

Late-game, you can use Drones to trivialise long-distance transportation of materials, assuming you produce enough Batteries to support them.

![A Drone delivers packaged nitrogen gas and takes empty canisters away](https://github.com/PFQNiet/Satisfactorio/raw/master/.modportal/drone-port.mp4)

Continue expanding your factory...

Win the game by completing Project Assembly!

## Compatibility
This mod is generally **incompatible** with other mods, as it totally replaces Factorio's systems with those from Satisfactory. Any mod that attempts to add technology, for example, will cause the mod to outright refuse to load.

However, compatibility patches can be made! The following mods are compatible:

* Rate Calculator
* Bottleneck Lite
* Text Plates
* Factorissimo 2

If you have any particular requests, please let me know.

I also recommend [Satisfactory Tools](https://u4.satisfactorytools.com/production) if you want a calculator to plan factories.

## HELP WANTED
As you can see from the screenshots and clips above, the graphics for this mod are currently lacking. Buildings are just white cards with the building's icon in the middle.

If you have experience making graphics for Factorio mods and would like to help, **please reach out**, I'd love to hear from you.
